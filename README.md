**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Photograph/Kiter)`**

As a computer science student, coding has become a passion for me. I love the feeling of creating something new and seeing my ideas come to life through code. There is a certain satisfaction that comes with solving complex problems and making something work seamlessly.

Coding allows me to express my creativity and curiosity in a tangible way, and I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning and improving my skills. It's amazing how a few lines of code can transform an abstract concept into a functional application that people can use and benefit from.

Moreover, coding has opened up a world of possibilities for me. It has given me the ability to create solutions to real-world problems and make an impact on people's lives. I feel empowered to tackle challenges and make a difference through my coding skills.

Overall, coding is not just a skill or hobby for me, it's a way of thinking and approaching problems. It's something that I love and am passionate about, and I am excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that coding has to offer.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Nico's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding experience began with creating an ambilight for my monitor using an Arduino. This project introduced me to the world of programming and sparked my interest in smart home technology. From there, I continued to explore the field and gained experience working on various projects. While I had some previous experience with HTML, I began to study Java in university and worked on small projects to further develop my skills. Recently, I have started to learn Python and am continuing to build upon my knowledge in the field.

In terms of getting hired, I believe my diverse experience and willingness to learn new languages and technologies would make me a strong candidate for a software engineering position. My background in creating smart home projects showcases my ability to apply programming concepts to practical, real-world problems. Additionally, my education in computer science has given me a solid foundation in programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

I am excited to continue to grow my skills and experience and am confident that my passion for programming and dedication to learning will make me a valuable asset to any team.
